*Note about coding conventions*

This project contains arrays that start at both 0 and 1. Where possible, this is specified in the array creation script. For arrays where a reference to a cell or a letter of the alphabet is implied, the array starts at 1 to make things easier to understand. However, for others, the normal coding custom of starting at 0 is observed. I have tried to comment and identify where these differences can be found.
